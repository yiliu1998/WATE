# WATE
`WATE` is an R package implementing rate doubly robust (RDR) estimators and their variance estimations for weighted average treatment effects (WATEs). The WATE is a class of general causal estimands targeting different population defined by propensity score weights (see [Li et al.(2018)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2016.1260466) as a representative paper for this concept). The package contains three RDR estimators and two classical (naive) estimators. We allow users implement the estimation and inference for a number of popular WATEs, including ATE, ATT, ATC, ATO (overlap weights), ATM (matching weights), ATEN (entropy weights), and ATB (beta family weights). The three proposed RDR estimators include: 

* the efficient influence function (EIF)-based estimator; and
* two double/debiased machine learning (DML)-based estimators (denoted as DML-1 and DML-2), which are technically by applying the sample-splitting and cross-fitting ([Chernozhukov et al. (2018)](https://academic.oup.com/ectj/article/21/1/C1/5056401)) to the EIF-based estimator.

The two classical (naive) estimators are the propensity score weighting estimator and the outcome imputation estimator. They are referred to as naive-1 and naive-2 estimators in our paper, respectively. 

## Installation
To install the latest version of the R package from GitHub, please run following commands in R:

```r
if (!require("devtools"))
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("yiliu1998/WATE")
```

## Demonstration

We demonstrate the use of `WATE` package as follows. First, the following code load the package and two sets of pre-generated observational data (`df.homo` and `df.hete`). These example data are a part of the package and can be loaded in your R when the package is installed. 

```r
library(WATE)
load(system.file("data", "example.Rdata", package="RDRwate"))
```

A quick look to the generated data:

```r
head(df.hete)
```

```r

```

We also allow users to specify different methods for nuisance function estimation and prediction in our RDR estimators of WATE. The complete list of these methods can be found using the following code. 

```r
SuperLearner::listWrappers()
```

Next, we can implement our package using code as follows. We consider evaluating the following estimands: ATE (overall), ATT (treated), ATC (controls), ATO (overlap weights), ATM (matching weights), ATEN (entropy), and two ATB's (beta weights, with $\nu_1=\nu_2\in$ {3,5}). As an example, we consider applying our method on the dataset `df.hete`. We include `SL.glm`, `SL.glm.interaction` and `SL.glmnet` in the ensemble library of `SuperLearner` for getting our nuisance function estimates. 

As an important remark, we do not currently allow **missing data** (in all covariates, treatment and outcome) in the dataset. Therefore, if your data have missing values, we suggest either doing a complete-case analysis or imputing missing data first. Once the data is cleaned and prepared, it is ready to run our methods. The first step is to extract the binary treatment vector, outcome vector and covariates matrix (can also be a data frame). 

```r
A <- df.hete$A
Y <- df.hete$Y
X <- df.hete %>% select(-A, -Y)
```

Then, plug-in these arguments to our main function `RDRwate()`: 

```r
v1 <- c(3,5)
v2 <- c(3,5)
beta=TRUE
result.eif <- RDRwate(A=A, Y=Y, X=X, beta=beta, v1=v1, v2=v2,
                      method="EIF", 
                      ps.library=c("SL.glm", "SL.glmnet"),
                      out.library=c("SL.glm", "SL.glmnet"),
                      seed=1)
print(result.eif)
```

```r

8 beta(5,5) 10.029801 0.87891157
```

We apply the two DML-based methods using a 5-fold cross-fitting with 10 different sample-splittings (i.e., repeating cross-fitting 10 times by **different** random sample splits). 

```r
v1 <- c(3,5)
v2 <- c(3,5)
beta=TRUE
result.dml <- RDRwate(A=A, Y=Y, X=X, beta=beta, v1=v1, v2=v2,
                      method="DML", n.folds=5, n.split=10, 
                      ps.library=c("SL.glm", "SL.glmnet"),
                      out.library=c("SL.glm", "SL.glmnet"),
                      seed=1)
print(result.dml)
```

The printed results of DML-based methods contain both mean and median-correction strategies for standard error estimation, which is based on the practical recommendation in [Chernozhukov et al. (2018)](https://academic.oup.com/ectj/article/21/1/C1/5056401). In this example, DML-1 and DML-2 do not make too outstanding difference, and both mean and median stratgies for the standard error are also similar. However, in some cases, the median strategy should be more robust because there could be extreme variances in a small number of sample-splittings. The two DML-based estimators also have similar results to the EIF-based estimator on all WATEs on this data set.
